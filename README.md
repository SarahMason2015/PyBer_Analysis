**<h1>PyBer Analysis</h1>**

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p> Pyber, a rideshare app company has come to me to complete an exploratory analysis on their rideshare program. The data provided is from January to early May of 2019. The information gathered will be based around city types, fares, and driver counts. With this data I will be creating visualization of my findings. Ideally, Pyber will be able to see where and potentially how to improve access and affordability to current areas served as well as underprivileged and underserved areas. 
<h2>Results and Analysis</h2>
<p>Supply and demand drive the rideshare industry. Higher population equals more rides and more drivers. As shown below urban areas always have a bigger slice of the pie. The result, fare goes down. As population decrease so do the driver counts and potential demand. This drives the fare up. The more people there are, the more drivers there will be, and cost goes down. Urban areas are the largest, suburban, then rural. 
  

<p>The proof is in the numbers, see below for a visualization of how I came to my conclusion:

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> PyBer would like to help the underserved and underprivileged areas. As visualized above, the areas most underserved are suburban, and rural areas. To help PyBer increase their presence in these areas I first believe they need to see if there is an actual need. Urban areas have more places to go, things to do. Suburban areas tend to have more families, they’re not interested in the same things as people who live in more urban areas. This also applies to rural areas; the needs are different. I believe it would be helpful to analyze where people are going, what are they doing, and is it for business, pleasure, or day to day errands. Knowing these things, will allow us to see if there is a need, and how best to fix it. 
  
  
</h4><p> Listed below are recommendations on ways PyBer can help:</h4>
   
1.	Create a program to help people with their general errands. Groceries, pharmacy, appointments, and other necessary tasks. This could be a timed, or per hour type of trip. 
1.	The people who need the most help, sometimes can’t afford to be price gouged. Make it affordable. Create a new baseline for fares in areas with less drivers available instead of raising the prices. 
1.	Incentivize drivers for completing trips in underserved areas. Also, people are more likely to tip better when they’re not feeling gouged!
